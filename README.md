We started from the market prices of the options, we derived the implied volatilities thanks to the Black-Scholes formula and calibrated them based on the RMSE. Then we implemented Monte Carlo simulation, to simulate the prices of the underlying at maturity (Geometric Brownian Motion).
We then calculate risk metrics and risk profiles (EE, EPE, EEE, EEPE) and so we derived the EAD and the Potential Future Exposure. We were able now to derive the Risk Weighted Asset, at the trade level and portfolio level (with netting and non-netting). 
The portfolio was composed by European and Asian Put and Call options
